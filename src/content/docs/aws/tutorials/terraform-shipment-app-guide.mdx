[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) enables you to develop and test cloud applications locally by emulating AWS services on your machine. In this tutorial, you will deploy a full-stack serverless shipment tracking application using Terraform and LocalStack.

This sample app consists of a React frontend and a Spring Boot backend, integrating with key AWS services like API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, SNS, and SQS. The infrastructure is managed entirely using Terraform, demonstrating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) workflows.

![Terraform Fullstack Serverless Shipment App Architecture](https://github.com/localstack-samples/sample-terraform-fullstack-serverless-shipment-app/raw/master/sample-pictures/architecture.png)

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools and dependencies are installed and configured on your local machine before proceeding:

- **LocalStack** (preferably Team or Pro edition for advanced features)
- **Terraform CLI**
- **AWS CLI** with the [awslocal](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/integrations/aws-native-tools/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal) wrapper for LocalStack
- **Maven 3.8.5+** and **Java 17** for Spring Boot backend
- **Node.js** and **npm** for React frontend
- **make** (optional, but recommended for simplified commands)

## Installation

Clone the sample repository and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/localstack-samples/sample-terraform-fullstack-serverless-shipment-app.git
cd sample-terraform-fullstack-serverless-shipment-app

make install
```

This command builds the Lambda validator JAR and installs frontend Node.js packages.

## Deployment

Start LocalStack in the background with your authorization token configured:

```
localstack auth set-token <your-auth-token>
localstack start -d
```

Use the provided Makefile to deploy all infrastructure components:

```
make deploy
```

This creates and configures:

- S3 buckets for shipment images and Lambda code
- DynamoDB tables preloaded with sample shipments
- Lambda functions for image validation and processing
- SNS topics and SQS queues for event messaging
- Required IAM roles and permissions

## Running the Application

### Start React Frontend

```
cd shipment-list-frontend
npm start
```

Access the UI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Start Spring Boot Backend

In a separate terminal, run:

```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

The backend API will be available at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

## Testing

Run full end-to-end tests with:

```
make test
```

## Using the Application

- View shipment list on the React frontend.
- Upload shipment images; valid ones are watermarked by the Lambda function.
- Invalid files are automatically replaced.
- Real-time updates are delivered via Server-Sent Events.
- Create, update, or delete shipments through provided UI and API endpoints.

## Summary and Use Cases

This project illustrates:

- Deploying AWS resources (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS) with Terraform.
- Serverless image processing and validation using Lambda.
- Reactive messaging using SNS and SQS.
- Seamless switching between AWS and LocalStack via Spring Profiles.
- Integration testing using Testcontainers.
- Using LocalStack CLI wrappers (`awslocal`, `tflocal`) for streamlined local development.
- Infrastructure as Code testing enabling consistent, repeatable environment setups.
